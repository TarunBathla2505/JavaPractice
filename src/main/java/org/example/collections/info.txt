1. fix the issue for having different methods for adding and getting values from different data structure


Collection:
    1. represents a group of objects its an interface which provides methods to work on group of objects.
    2. methods -> size, isEmpty, contains, toArray, add, remove, addAll, removeAll, clear, equals, stream and parallelStream, iterator

Collections:
    1. utility class which provides static methods, which are used to operate over collection like swapping, searching, reverse, copy etc.
    2. methods -> sort, binarySearch, get, reverse, shuffle, swap, copy, min, max, rotate, unmodifiableCollection etc.

Comparator and Comparable both provides a way to sort the collections of object.

Comparator
    1. functional interface
    2. method ->
        int compare(T obj1,T obj2)
