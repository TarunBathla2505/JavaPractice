* Map -> HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap

methods -> size, isEmpty, containsKey, containsValue, get, put, remove, putAll, putIfAbsent, values, keySet

* HashTable is synchronised version of hashmap and it is thread safe
hashtable does not save null key or null value


* LinkedHashMap is similar to HashMap but it maintains insertion order
also it can help us maintain the access order

it used double linked list
